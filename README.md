### Hi there 👋, Welcome to Simon's Github

I am a CS PhD Student at Stanford 🌲. Previously, I studied 🐻 studying Electrical Engineering ⚡ and Computer Sciences 💻 at UC Berkeley. I am interested in designing and scaling intelligent systems, from model architectures to efficient systems to performant hardware.

<!--
Feel free to take a look around my repos and contributions, here are some one of the ones I want to highlight:
* [ucb-bar/onnxruntime-riscv](https://github.com/ucb-bar/onnxruntime-riscv) - ML Inference Engine for RISC-V accelerators.
* [erdos-project/frenet_optimal_trajectory_planner](https://github.com/erdos-project/frenet_optimal_trajectory_planner) - Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning with variable runtime deadline.
* [BerkeleyBlockchain/dev-decal-sp20](https://github.com/BerkeleyBlockchain/dev-decal-sp20) - A course I designed and taught about blockchain and distributed systems development.
* [HKNDecal/HKNDecal](https://github.com/HKNDecal/HKNDecal) - A course I taught to introduce freshman all aspects of the EECS stack-->

Previously I worked on pretraining 🔮 at [@cohere-ai](https://cohere.com/), 📱 GPUs at [@apple](https://cohere.com/), distributed computing 🕸️ at [@anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), and autonomous vehicles 🚗 [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/). In earlier times, I also did some hardware product prototyping ⚙️ [@HAX](https://hax.co/) and consumer neurotech 🧠 [@Interaxon](https://choosemuse.com/).

I used to do a lot of hackathons 🌙, having been to 30+ and won 10 awards, as well as organizing a few.
