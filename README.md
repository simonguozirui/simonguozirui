### Hi there 👋, Welcome to Simon's Github

I am a student at UC Berkeley 🐻 studying Electrical Engineering ⚡ and Computer Sciences 💻.
My main focus is on accelerated computing, [real-time ML systems such as autonomous vehicles](https://bit.ly/simon-self-driving), and distributed systems.
<br/>

Feel free to take a look around my repos and contributions, here are some one of the ones I want to highlight:
* [ucb-bar/onnxruntime-riscv](https://github.com/ucb-bar/onnxruntime-riscv) - ML Inference Engine for RISC-V accelerators.
* [erdos-project/frenet_optimal_trajectory_planner](https://github.com/erdos-project/frenet_optimal_trajectory_planner) - Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning with variable runtime deadline.
* [BerkeleyBlockchain/dev-decal-sp20](https://github.com/BerkeleyBlockchain/dev-decal-sp20) - A course I designed and taught about blockchain and distributed systems development.
* [HKNDecal/HKNDecal](https://github.com/HKNDecal/HKNDecal) - A course I taught to introduce freshman all aspects of the EECS stack

I am joining [@anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/) to work on distributed computing 🕸️ next summer. Previously I worked on autonomous vehicles 🚗 [@NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/) hardware product prototyping ⚙️ [@HAX](https://hax.co/), and consumer neurotech 🧠 [@Interaxon](https://choosemuse.com/).

I used to do a lot of hackathons 🌙, having been to 30+ and won 10 awards, as well as organizing a few. See [list](https://bit.ly/simon-hackathon).
